## 1.2 Scope of the Quality Management System

This Quality Management System governs the design, procurement, manufacturing, inspection, and documentation of factory-built residential structures at the Fort Homes LLC manufacturing facility in Grand Junction, Colorado.

**Product Scope:**

| Product Type | Description | Dimensions |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Single Module** | Factory-built residential unit | 12'-14' wide × 30'-60' long × ≤13'6" transport height |
| **Double-Wide Module** | Multi-section unit, joined on-site | 24'-28' wide (combined) |
| **Stackable Design** | Modules engineered for vertical assembly | Up to 3 stories |

**Manufacturing Method:** Build-in-Place (Static Bay) with 5-bay production system.

**Closed Construction:** This QMS specifically addresses concealed components where mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems are installed within wall, floor, or ceiling cavities at the factory and are inaccessible for inspection at the installation site. Mandatory in-plant inspection hold points are established to certify these concealed components before enclosure.

**Process Scope:**
- Design review and plan approval coordination
- Procurement and receiving inspection
- Manufacturing operations (8 production phases)
- Quality inspection and testing
- Third-party inspection coordination
- Documentation and record retention
- Shipping and site interface

## 1.3 Quality Policy

Fort Homes LLC is committed to manufacturing high-quality, code-compliant modular residential structures that meet or exceed the requirements of the Colorado Division of Housing, applicable building codes, and customer expectations.

We achieve this through:

1. **Compliance:** Strict adherence to DOH regulations (8 CCR 1302-14), adopted building codes, and approved plans.

2. **Workmanship:** Employing skilled craftspeople and implementing standardized processes to ensure consistent quality.

3. **Inspection:** Maintaining rigorous inspection protocols at defined hold points throughout the manufacturing process.

4. **Documentation:** Creating complete, accurate records that demonstrate compliance and enable traceability.

5. **Improvement:** Continuously analyzing performance data and implementing corrective actions to enhance quality.

6. **Training:** Ensuring all personnel possess the competencies required to perform their assigned responsibilities.

**Quality Policy Statement:**

*"Fort Homes builds quality into every module through disciplined processes, rigorous inspection, and a commitment to continuous improvement. We will not ship any unit that does not meet our standards and regulatory requirements."*

— Jeff Zimmerman, President

## 1.4 Quality Objectives

| Objective | Metric | Target | Measurement Frequency |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **First-Pass Inspection Rate** | Modules passing all hold points without rework | ≥95% | Monthly |
| **NCR Rate** | Non-conformances per module produced | ≤2.0 | Monthly |
| **TPIA Pass Rate** | Third-party inspections passed on first attempt | ≥98% | Per inspection |
| **Customer Complaints** | Warranty claims per module shipped | ≤0.5 | Quarterly |

2. **Foundation Design:** Site-specific foundation design is the responsibility of the project engineer. Fort Homes provides interface requirements and recommended foundation specifications.

3. **Land Development:** Site preparation, utilities, and infrastructure are outside the manufacturing scope.
